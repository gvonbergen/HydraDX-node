	/// Since BABE is probabilistic this is the average expected block time that
	/// we are targeting. Blocks will be produced at a minimum duration defined
	/// by `SLOT_DURATION`, but some slots will not be allocated to any
	/// authority and hence no block will be produced. We expect to have this
	/// block time on average following the defined slot duration and the value
	/// of `c` configured for BABE (where `1 - c` represents the probability of
	/// a slot being empty).
	/// This value is only used indirectly to define the unit constants below
	/// that are expressed in blocks. The rest of the code should use
	/// `SLOT_DURATION` instead (like the Timestamp pallet for calculating the
	/// minimum period).
	///
	/// If using BABE with secondary slots (default) then all of the slots will
	/// always be assigned, in which case `MILLISECS_PER_BLOCK` and
	/// `SLOT_DURATION` should have the same value.
